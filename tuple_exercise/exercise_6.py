# Copy specific elements from one tuple to a new tuple
# Write a program to copy elements 44 and 55 from the following tuple into a new tuple.
# Given:
# tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)
tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

# Copy elements 44 and 55 into a new tuple
new_tuple = tuple1[3:5]

# Print the new tuple
print(new_tuple)
